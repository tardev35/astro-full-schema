# Rebrand this Astro site to a new brand

This repo is a shared Astro template reused across many Thai slot/casino
client sites (see the `NavbarStyle*`, `FooterStyle*`, `ContentBox*Premium/Cyber/Huay`
variants in `src/components`). "Launching a new brand" means: swap the
content and color palette to match a new client's docx brief and image
assets, while reusing the existing component tree — never deleting or
skipping a component `index.astro` already imports.

Work through these phases in order. Don't skip the verification phase —
every past run of this skill has caught at least one real bug there.

**Build cadence: run `npm run build` exactly ONCE, in Phase 5 — not
between edits.** A full `astro build` is the single most expensive step
in this workflow, and rebuilding after each component/page wastes most
of the wall-clock time a rebrand takes. Do all the editing across
Phases 2–4.5 first, then build once at the start of Phase 5 and run
every `dist/`-based grep check against that one build. The only time
you build again is if Phase 5 surfaces a bug and you fix it — then one
more build to confirm. Any instruction in an earlier phase that says
"verify with `npm run build` then grep `dist/…`" means *defer that grep
to the Phase 5 build*, not kick off a build then and there.

## Optional: run the rebrand as parallel subagents

**Default for full rebrands.** Run a full rebrand this way *by default* —
the repo owner has given standing approval, so you do **not** need the
user to type "ขนาน"/"parallel" each time (though those cues still apply).
Fall back to fully sequential only when the user explicitly asks
("ทีละสเต็ป", "sequential", "อย่าแตก agent") or when the task is a Phase 7
single-component follow-up (parallelizing one component isn't worth the
spawn cost — do those yourself). This mode changes *who* runs Phases
2–4.5 and in what order — **not what those phases do**. Every rule in
Phases 1–7 still applies in full to each subagent; nothing here relaxes
them.

The split is **by non-overlapping files, never by "type of work."** No
two subagents may ever edit the same file — so the shared "chrome" that
renders on *every* page has to be finished *before* the fan-out, by you,
not by either subagent.

**Step P0 — you (orchestrator) do Phase 1 + the variant-selection part
of Phase 2 yourself, up front.** Extract the docx, read the images, pick
each family's variant (Navbar / Footer / Announcement / LatestWinners /
ContentBox-mix per the Phase 2 rotation rule), and write brand name +
palette (old→new hex + Tailwind hue) + chosen variants + the numbered
docx-heading checklist into **one** scratchpad "brand spec" file. All
subagents read that single file — they must **not** re-extract the docx
or re-pick variants (that would risk two agents choosing differently).

**Step P1 — you retheme the SHARED chrome sequentially, before fan-out,
then commit it as the baseline every fan-out agent builds on.** Compute the shared
set *each run* (don't trust a stale list — variant rotation changes which
navbar/footer is active): the active `MainLayout.astro` + the single
`Navbar*`/`Footer*` it imports + `Navfoot.astro`, **plus any component
imported by ≥2 files under `src/pages/`** (grep the page-level imports to
find them; as of the 999LORD brand that extra set is `ContentBox.astro`
and `Announcement4.astro`). Retheme all of these per Phase 3. This is the
collision zone; getting it done first is what makes the fan-out agents
disjoint.

**Step P2 — fan out subagents (`Agent` tool), zero file overlap:**
- **Agent A — Landing.** Owns `src/pages/index.astro` and every component
  *only* index renders — built **recursively** (e.g. `LoginRtpSection` →
  `ContentBoxTwo`), MINUS every file in the P1 shared set. Runs Phase 2
  (content mapping) + Phase 3 + Phase 4 (stale-asset fixes) for those
  files.
- **Agents B and C — Sub-pages, split between them.** Together they own
  every *other* `src/pages/*.astro` and the components *only* those pages
  render (e.g. `AnnouncementHuay`, `ContentBoxHuay`), MINUS the P1 shared
  set. Each runs Phase 4.5 for its own pages (including the `Huay`-theme
  exception). **Any preset page the uploader scaffolded (e.g.
  `บทความ.astro`, `about-us.astro` — spot them by a `TODO(rebrand)`
  placeholder body) belongs to whichever of the two owns it:** fill its
  body from the docx and verify its navbar link, per Phase 4.5. The
  active navbar itself lives in the P1 shared set, so if either needs to
  hand-add a nav link there, flag it for the orchestrator rather than
  editing it directly.

  **How to split B/C:** deal the sub-pages out so each side gets a
  similar amount of *writing*, then assign each page's private components
  to whichever agent owns that page. A page is one agent's or the other's
  — never split a page. Sub-pages are already separate files, so this
  costs nothing in collision risk; it exists because Agent A owns one
  file (`index.astro`, the largest) while B used to own four to six
  pages, which made B the tail everything waited on.

  **Drop to a single Agent B when there are two or fewer sub-pages to
  do** — below that the spawn overhead outweighs the split. Likewise, if
  a rebrand somehow grows past ~8 sub-pages, add an Agent D on the same
  rule rather than overloading C.

Each subagent's brief MUST state, explicitly: (1) the exact file list it
owns; (2) a **"do NOT touch"** list = the P1 shared-chrome files + the
other agents' files; (3) the Phase-2 rule that unused component variants
are inventory and must never be deleted; (4) "read the brand-spec
scratchpad file for name/palette/variants; do not re-extract the docx or
re-choose variants"; (5) **"do NOT run `npm run build`"** — the single
build stays with you in Phase 5, per the build-cadence rule above. A
subagent that builds mid-flight both wastes the most expensive step and
can't see the other agents' not-yet-merged edits anyway.

**Step P3 — you merge + verify.** After every fan-out agent reports back, run
Phase 5 (the one build), Phase 6 (the closing report), and any Phase 7 follow-ups
yourself. If verification shows a shared-chrome component needs a further
change, make it **yourself** in this step — never send a subagent back
into the shared set after fan-out.

**Fallback — when the split can't be made clean:** if a component you
need to retheme is shared across zones (so no single agent can own it
safely), pull it into the P1 shared step and retheme it there instead of
splitting it. Fewer files in the parallel zone is always safer than a
collision; when in doubt, widen P1 and shrink the fan-out.

## Phase 1 — Gather brand inputs

**How this rebrand was likely triggered.** The `tools/rebrand-uploader` tool
(launch by double-clicking `tools/rebrand-uploader/start-uploader.cmd` — no VS
Code needed — or `npm run rebrand:upload`, opens `localhost:4444`) is where the
operator stages the brand files first. Its **"ส่วนที่ 6 — สร้างคำสั่ง Rebrand"**
card produces the very prompt that starts you, in the form
`rebrand and retheme to "<BRAND>" then real url is "<URL>" ทำแบบขนานตาม
playbook`. So when you receive that shape of request: the logo/banner/slide/docx
are already in `src/assets`, the `ขนาน`/`playbook` phrase means run the
default parallel workflow above (older saved prompts say `2-agent ขนาน` — same
thing; the agent count comes from the playbook, not from the prompt), and `real url is "<URL>"` is the explicit real
domain (per the URL-scope rule below) — if that clause is absent, the operator
left it blank on purpose: **do not change the domain.** Still run every phase in
full; the prompt is only the trigger, not a shortcut around verification.

That card can either copy the prompt for a human to paste, or **fire it
directly** — its "เริ่ม Rebrand" button spawns `claude -p` on this repo with
`--permission-mode bypassPermissions` and streams the run back into the page. A
fired run carries the extra clause `— หยุดที่ build + verify เท่านั้น ห้าม deploy
และห้าม git push`, and it means exactly what it says: **nobody is watching, no
permission prompt will stop you.** Finish at Phase 6 verification (`npm run
build` clean + grep the rendered HTML) and stop there. Do not deploy, do not
`git push`, and do not `git commit` unless the operator asked in the notes
field. Everything the run prints is visible live in the browser, so report
progress in the normal way — there is no separate channel to write to.

1. **Find the brief.** **Try `src/assets/content.txt` first — one `Read`
   and you are done.** The uploader extracts every paragraph of the docx
   at upload time and writes it there, so in the normal flow (operator
   staged the brief through ส่วนที่ 1) there is nothing to unzip. This is
   the head of the critical path: no other phase can start until the
   brief is read, so don't spend three tool calls re-deriving a file that
   already exists.

   The brief may have arrived as a `.docx` **or as a plain `.txt`** — the
   uploader takes either and normalises both to `content.txt`, so this
   step does not change. A text brief leaves **no** `content.docx` at
   all (the uploader deletes any previous brand's), which is expected,
   not a missing file: `content.txt` is the source in that case, not a
   derived copy. Do not go looking for a `.docx` to "verify" it against.

   Fall back to the manual extraction below **only** when `content.txt`
   is missing — a brief that predates the uploader, or a `.docx` dropped
   into `src/assets`/`src/components` by hand (past runs named it
   `<brand>-content.docx`). The `Read` tool cannot open `.docx` directly:
   ```bash
   unzip -o "<path-to.docx>" -d "$SCRATCHPAD/docx_extract"
   python -c "
   import re
   with open(r'$SCRATCHPAD/docx_extract/word/document.xml', encoding='utf-8') as f:
       xml = f.read()
   paras = re.findall(r'<w:p[ >].*?</w:p>', xml, re.DOTALL)
   out = [''.join(re.findall(r'<w:t[^>]*>(.*?)</w:t>', p, re.DOTALL)) for p in paras]
   print(chr(10).join(out))
   "
   ```
   On Windows/git-bash, pass Windows-style paths (`C:/Users/...`) to
   `python`, not `/c/Users/...` posix paths — the python.exe on this
   box doesn't resolve those. `unzip` may exit 2 with a harmless
   trailing-bytes warning; check the extracted files landed before
   worrying about it.
2. **Read `src/assets/palette.json` before opening a single image.** The
   uploader measures the artwork with sharp at upload time and writes the
   colours out, so the palette arrives as exact hex instead of something
   you have to judge by eye. Two lists per image:
   - **`vivid`** — the brand hue. **This is the one to theme with.**
     Scored by saturation × area, with near-black/near-white/grey
     dropped. `logo.webp`'s `vivid` is the most reliable single source:
     a logo is mostly brand colour with little background noise.
   - **`dominant`** — the most *area*, which on a banner or slide is
     nearly always the dark background. Useful for the page/section
     background, misleading as an accent.

   Then **read the reference images** in `src/assets` with the `Read`
   tool (it renders images visually) — logo, banner(s), slide(s), bg.
   You still need your eyes for everything the numbers can't say. Note:
   - which of the measured colours is actually the *accent* vs the
     background (palette.json ranks, it doesn't interpret), and whether
     the brand reads as one hue or a two-colour pair
   - the mood/genre (ocean, neon-cyberpunk, gold-luxury, etc.) — this
     drives which existing component *variant* families
     (`*Premium`, `*Cyber`, `*Huay`, plain) best fit, if the user says
     you may pick from the wider component library
   - if the user pastes one specific image path as "ref", treat it as
     the primary hero reference (see Phase 4 hero-selection bug).
   - **`banner*` splits into two roles by number, `slide*` is content.**
     `banner1` is the site's single **hero** banner (the one
     `MainLayout.astro`'s glob picks — see Phase 4); every **higher-
     numbered banner (`banner2`, `banner3`, `banner4`)** is a spare
     **article-illustration image** for composing the front page, *not*
     another hero candidate. This is what the `tools/rebrand-uploader`
     UI stages them as (`banner1` = hero, `banner2-4` = "รูปประกอบ
     บทความ").
   - **`banner2/3/4` go INSIDE a single-column `ContentBox` as a
     resized inline illustration — never a `ContentBoxSevenThree`
     column, never a full-width strip, never the hero.** Pick the
     single-col docx section the banner best fits (e.g. a cashback/
     bonus banner → the register/promo section), drop the image into
     that box's slot, and **cap its width so it sits "พอดี"** — e.g.
     `mx-auto h-auto w-full max-w-2xl rounded-2xl` — not edge-to-edge.
     Only use a `banner2+` file that belongs to the *current* asset
     drop (check the mtime / that it's not a stale leftover from an
     older brand — a `banner3.png` dated before the new `banner1/2`
     drop is old inventory, skip it). It's fine to leave a `banner2+`
     unused if no section fits; don't force it or turn it into a hero.
   - **`slide*` (promotion/carousel) images are the exact opposite of
     `banner2/3/4`: they go ONLY inside a `ContentBoxSevenThree*`
     image+text block — never a plain `ContentBox`, a standalone `<img>`,
     a full-width strip, or a card grid (see the Phase 2 HARD RULE).** So
     the whole front-page image split is: **`banner1` = hero, `banner2/3/4`
     = single-column `ContentBox` illustrations (if present), `slide*` =
     `ContentBoxSevenThree*` only.**
   - **`banner1-mobile` is not a fifth banner — it is `banner1` again,
     cropped for phones.** `MainLayout` pins it in its own glob and, when
     present, renders it as a `<source media="(max-width: 767px)">` inside
     the hero `<picture>`, so a phone fetches it *instead of* `banner1`,
     never as well. It is optional; with no such file there is no `<source>`
     and phones get `banner1`. **Never place it in a `ContentBox`, never
     treat it as article art, and never point the hero at it directly** —
     doing that ships phone-cropped art to desktop.

     Being optional is the whole risk: a file left on disk would keep
     serving the *previous* brand's hero on phones, the one viewport
     nobody opens while reviewing. The uploader deletes `banner1-mobile.*`
     whenever `banner1` is uploaded without a replacement, which ties its
     lifetime to the desktop banner's. If you stage assets by hand instead
     of through the uploader, **you own that deletion** — check
     `src/assets/banner1-mobile.*` against this drop's mtime and remove it
     if it is older, exactly as you would a stale `banner3`.
3. Confirm the new brand name and check `astro.config.mjs` `site:` —
   it's often already been updated to the new domain before you're
   asked to do the content work.

**Never invent a domain from the brand name.** A bare "rebrand to
`<brand>`" request is content/design work only — it does *not* license
guessing a URL like `https://www.<brand>.com` from the brand name, a
reference image, or the docx (a past run guessed a domain off a
reference image that happened to show a URL, and it was wrong). Leave
`astro.config.mjs`'s `site:` and any hardcoded `url:` string literal in
`index.astro`'s `webSiteSchema`/similar schema.org objects exactly as
they already are — even if they still show a previous brand's domain,
that's expected drift, not something to silently "fix." Only touch
those spots when the user explicitly gives a real URL alongside the
brand name (e.g. "rebrand to `<brand>` and real url `<XXXX>`"), and
then set each to that exact URL — don't miss the schema.org one, it's a
plain string literal that doesn't auto-follow `site:` the way
`Astro.url.origin`-derived values do. **There is a third file too — see
the `wrangler.toml` warning below.**

`robots.txt` used to be a third spot; it isn't any more. It is generated
by `src/pages/robots.txt.ts` from `site:`, so it follows the domain on
its own. **Do not re-create `public/robots.txt`** — a static file there
would silently win over the generated route.

The **contact address** on `/contact-us` does **not** work this way and needs
nothing from the prompt: it is derived from `BRAND_NAME` against the real
77-province table in `src/lib/thaiProvinces.ts`, so setting the brand sets the
address in the same edit. Leave it alone unless the operator hands you a real
registered address — see the `BRAND_ADDRESS` bullet in Phase 2.

### 🚨 `wrangler.toml` `name` — the one that destroys another brand's site

Sites deploy to Cloudflare Workers now (see
[`DEPLOY-CLOUDFLARE.md`](../../../DEPLOY-CLOUDFLARE.md)), and
**`name` in `wrangler.toml` IS the deployment identity.** Deploying with a
name that already belongs to another brand does not fail, warn, or create
anything new — it **overwrites that brand's live Worker**, and the site
that was on it is gone the moment someone runs `wrangler deploy`.

So when a real URL is given, that is **three** files, not two:

| file | change | why |
|---|---|---|
| `astro.config.mjs` | `site:` | canonical, sitemap, robots all derive from it |
| `src/pages/index.astro` | `webSiteSchema` `url:` (and any sibling schema literal) | plain string, does not follow `site:` |
| **`wrangler.toml`** | **`name`** | **reusing another brand's name deletes its site** |

Set `name` to something derived from the brand — lowercase, no spaces,
e.g. brand `MAHORANLOTTO` → `name = "mahoranlotto"`. It must not match any
name a previous brand used.

**One exception, and it inverts the rule: if this domain was already parked**
with the placeholder page (`tools/domain-placeholder/`), the Worker for it
already exists and the name **must match the parked one exactly** — that
overwrite is what keeps the Custom Domain and DNS untouched. Inventing a fresh
name there produces a second Worker while the domain keeps serving "Coming
soon", with no error anywhere. Ask the operator which name was parked rather
than guessing; `npx wrangler deployments list --name <name>` confirms it.

**Without an explicit real URL, leave all three alone**, exactly as with
`site:` above. A name that still reads as the previous brand is expected
drift on a content-only rebrand — the operator has not deployed anything
yet, and guessing here is what breaks a live site.

**`account_id` is NOT in that list — leave it as you find it.** It says
which Cloudflare account the Worker deploys into, and one account holds
five to ten brands, so it changes once per *group* of brands rather than
per brand. Carrying the previous brand's value over is almost always
right. Guessing one is worse than a wrong Worker name, because a wrong
account means the deploy lands somewhere nobody is looking.

Never edit it by hand even when the user does want a different account.
The uploader's card 7 has a **สลับบัญชี** button that runs the real
`wrangler logout`/`login` and then writes the id the operator picks from
the accounts that login can actually reach — which is the part a value
typed from memory gets wrong. See `DEPLOY-CLOUDFLARE.md` →
"สลับบัญชีเมื่อบัญชีเดิมครบจำนวน".

Two more keys in that file are load-bearing; **do not remove either**:
`workers_dev = false` keeps the duplicate `*.workers.dev` copy of the site
off the internet (it defaults to `true`, so deleting the line quietly
brings the duplicate back on the next deploy), and
`not_found_handling = "404-page"` stops every mistyped URL answering 200
with the home page.

**Leave `MainLayout.astro`'s `<head>` structure alone.** It looks
unusual on purpose: the optional blocks (icons / manifest / OG /
Twitter) are emitted in an order chosen by `src/lib/brandProfile.ts`
from the brand's own domain, and a few redundant tags
(`shortcut icon`, `twitter:url`, `og:locale`,
`apple-mobile-web-app-title`) appear on some brands and not others.
Every brand launched from this template used to ship a byte-identical
head, which linked all of them together for anyone reading the source;
that map exists to break the pattern. So during a rebrand:
- **do not** re-sort the head into a "canonical" order, hardcode the
  block sequence, or restore a tag "that's missing" — nothing is
  missing, and tidying it silently re-creates the footprint
- **do not** add a `google-site-verification` meta. Search Console is
  verified by DNS TXT record; the same token was previously hardcoded
  across every brand, which was the strongest cross-site link of all
- the head is per-domain but **stable** — the same domain always builds
  the same bytes, so a redeploy never churns a live site's markup
Retheming colors, copy, and components is untouched by any of this.

## Phase 2 — Map docx content onto existing component slots

List every component `src/pages/index.astro` currently imports and
uses. **Never remove one** — if an import is unused (check with Grep
for `<ComponentName` in the JSX body, not just the import line), that's
a bug in the current file: wire it up with real content instead of
deleting the import. (Past run: `Faq`/`FaqHuay` was imported but never
rendered, and its *default* prop content was a leftover FAQ from a
totally different old brand — fixed by passing a `faqs` prop with new
content, not by editing the shared component's defaults.)

Map each docx H1/H2/H3 section onto one existing slot 1:1 — most of
these templates have: hero title, an intro `ContentBox`, a two-column
`ContentBoxTwo` (often a login widget + a stats/provider table), a
three-column `ContentBox3Three`/`ContentBoxThreeColums`, at most one or
two image+text `ContentBoxSevenThree` blocks (see the hard 2-max rule
below — lean on single-column `ContentBox*` and two-column
`ContentBoxTwo*` for the rest), a `ContentBoxSpecial` two-half block,
review cards, and a FAQ. Don't
invent new sections or duplicate content across two slots — if the
docx has fewer sections than slots, some slots keep more generic
copy; if it has a specific list of game providers/payment methods,
prefer real values in **both** the provider grid/table props and any
provider-name mentions in prose paragraphs, so they don't contradict.

**Don't reach for plain `ContentBox` for every single section — use the
whole component "family," and this applies to every repeated family in
the repo, not just `ContentBox`.** `src/components/` groups many
sections into a base file plus mood-suffixed siblings — `Premium`,
`CyberCut`, `FloatingBadge`, `Huay`, `Neumorphism`, `Cyber`, plus
numbered `Style1..11` for navbars — different *shapes*, not just
different colors:
- `ContentBox`/`ContentBoxSevenThree`/`ContentBox3Three`/`ContentBoxTwo`
  — content section wrappers (see the image-pairing note below).
- `Announcement`/`Announcement2..6`/`AnnouncementCyber`/
  `AnnouncementPremium`/`AnnouncementHuay` — the scrolling top ticker.
  Every variant's `message` prop **defaults to a different old brand's
  slogan** (a past run found defaults for six unrelated old brands
  across this one family alone) — when you pick a variant, you must
  always pass an explicit `message` prop with the current brand's copy;
  never leave the default in place assuming it's generic filler.
- `LatestWinners`/`LatestWinners2..4`/`LatestWinnersCyber`/
  `LatestWinnersPremium`/`LatestWinnersHuay` — the live withdrawal/win
  feed. These are self-contained (own bank-logo imports) but the brand
  name and hue are hardcoded straight into the JSX, not passed as props —
  swapping variants means doing the full retheme + brand-name pass on the
  newly chosen file, same as any other component in Phase 3.

  **All seven now share `src/lib/winnersFeed.ts`, and none of them may go
  back to `<script define:vars>`** — that forces `is:inline`, which the
  gate fails on an indexable page, and it renders the feed container empty
  in the HTML (nothing for a crawler, nothing without JS, a guaranteed
  layout shift). The rows are server-rendered and the module only takes
  over the rotation.

  What that means when you retheme one: the row markup is yours to restyle
  freely, but keep the `data-winner-*` hooks on the elements that carry
  live values, and keep the initial rows coming from `brandPick`/
  `brandFlag` rather than `Math.random()` — frontmatter runs at build time,
  so a random call there makes two builds of the same domain differ and the
  gate rejects it. Everything the module needs to know is a `data-*` on the
  feed element (`data-interval`, `data-max-rows`, `data-amount-min/max`,
  `data-pending-chance`, `data-user-style`, `data-user-digits`,
  `data-insert`, `data-big-win-above`) or on a row element
  (`data-pending-text`/`data-done-text` and the matching `-class` pairs).
  Put this brand's wording and classes there; the module never learns the
  palette.
- `Navbar`/`NavbarStyle1..11`/`NavbarCyber`/`NavbarHuay`/
  `NavbarPremium` and `Footer`/`FooterStyle2..3`/`FooterCyber`/
  `FooterHuay`/`FooterPremium`(`Sumo`) — **unlike the families above,
  only one navbar file and one footer file are ever active at once**,
  imported directly into `MainLayout.astro`. "Picking a variant" here
  means choosing which single file to point `MainLayout.astro`'s
  import at (and updating that one import), not composing several on
  one page. Whichever one you pick, it almost certainly still has the
  *previous* brand's name hardcoded in a logo-fallback heading and
  footer copyright line (exactly like the currently-wired one did) —
  retheme and swap that text before wiring it in, not after.

  **Give every navbar menu item an icon.** The owner asked for this after
  seeing TUNGMA168's navbar (2026-08-01) and it applies from here on,
  whichever variant a brand picks. Roughly half the inventory has none —
  `NavbarPremium` is the one that was live when this was raised, and it
  ships plain text links.

  Do it the way `NavbarStyle1` does: put the icon in the `links` array
  next to `name` and `path`, then render it as its own
  `<span aria-hidden="true">` — a **sibling** of the label, never inside its
  text. Both halves are build errors; the reasoning is in "Accessibility rules
  the build now enforces" and is not repeated here.

  Several variants — `NavbarPremium` among them — declare the menu twice,
  once for desktop and once for the mobile drawer. Hoist that into one
  `links` const while you are in there rather than adding icons to both
  copies, or the next person edits one and not the other. Pick icons that
  match the brand's genre (a lottery brand's menu should not be led by a
  slot machine), and keep them to one per item.

  **Menu order: `สมัครสมาชิก` and `เข้าสู่ระบบ` go immediately after
  `โปรโมชั่น`, not at the end of the list.** Asked for on 2026-08-07, on
  WINNOW168's `NavbarStyle6`, and it applies to whichever variant a brand
  picks from here on. The order is:

  ```
  หน้าแรก · โปรโมชั่น · สมัครสมาชิก · เข้าสู่ระบบ · <everything else>
  ```

  Those two are the only menu entries that are conversion actions rather
  than pages to read, so they belong where a visitor scanning left-to-right
  reaches them before the informational pages (`ทดลองเล่น`, `เกี่ยวกับเรา`,
  `ติดต่อเรา`, `บทความ`). They arrive last because the uploader's ส่วนที่ 5
  **appends** a newly-toggled page's `{ name, path }` to the end of the
  `links` array — so every rebrand inherits them in the wrong place unless
  someone moves them. Reorder the array; do not special-case them in the
  markup.

  Two things this does NOT change: `หน้าแรก` stays first, and the header's
  own login/register **CTA buttons** (most variants have a pair pinned in a
  corner or in the mobile bar) are separate chrome — leave them where the
  variant puts them. If a brand has the cta toggle off, there are no
  `/register` and `/login` menu entries to order and this rule is a no-op.

**Rotate every family's variant on each rebrand — the ONE variant you
must not reuse is the one the previous brand had wired in.** This is a
hard rule, not a nice-to-have: these are unrelated clients on a shared
template, and two consecutive brands must not come out looking like the
same site with new colors. Before writing `index.astro`/`MainLayout.astro`,
for each family below, first *identify the outgoing brand's current pick*
(grep the live imports in `src/pages/index.astro` and
`src/layouts/MainLayout.astro`), then **deliberately choose a different
sibling** for the new brand — a different *shape*, not just a recolor of
the same one:
- **ContentBox family** (`ContentBox`/`*Premium`/`*CyberCut`/
  `*FloatingBadge`/`*SevenThree*`/`*3Three*`/`*Special`) — if the last
  brand leaned on `FloatingBadge` + `CyberCut`, this brand should lead
  with a different mix (e.g. `Premium` + plain + `Special`). Vary which
  shape carries the H1 hero vs the H2 sections.
- **Announcement family** (`Announcement`/`Announcement2..6`/
  `*Cyber`/`*Premium`/`*Huay`) — switch to a different ticker number/
  suffix than the one currently imported.
- **LatestWinners family** (`LatestWinners`/`2..4`/`*Cyber`/`*Premium`/
  `*Huay`) — pick a different feed variant than the live one, then do
  the full retheme + brand-name pass on the newly chosen file (its hue
  and brand name are hardcoded in JSX, not props).
- **Navbar / NavbarStyle family** (`Navbar`/`NavbarStyle1..11`/
  `*Cyber`/`*Huay`/`*Premium`) — point `MainLayout.astro` at a
  *different* single navbar file than the outgoing brand's, and retheme
  it. Only one is active at a time, so "rotating" here means changing
  which one file the layout imports.
- **Footer family** (`Footer`/`FooterStyle2..3`/`*Cyber`/`*Huay`/
  `*Premium`(`Sumo`)) — same as navbar: switch `MainLayout.astro` to a
  different single footer file and retheme it.
- **Brand font** — flip `BRAND_FONT` in `src/lib/brandProfile.ts` between
  `"kanit"` and `"google-sans"` so it is not the same as the outgoing
  brand's. **One line, and that is the whole change** — no component
  hardcodes a font name any more; they all read `var(--font-sans)`, and
  the layout puts the right stack on `<html>`. Do not edit
  `font-family` anywhere else, and do not add a Google Fonts `<link>` by
  hand: `MainLayout`, `login.astro` and `register.astro` each emit the
  correct one from that flag, and `brandProfile` drops the Kanit
  preloads when the brand is not on Kanit.

  This family matters more than it looks. A Kanit brand ships
  `@font-face` rules pointing at `/fonts/kanit-v17-latin_thai-*.woff2` —
  the *same four paths on every brand that uses it*, which is a sharper
  cross-brand match than anything visual. Rotating the font breaks that
  set in half.
- **Brand name** — set `BRAND_NAME` in `src/lib/brandProfile.ts` to the new
  brand, right under `BRAND_FONT`. Also one line. It feeds `og:site_name`,
  every JSON-LD `name`, and the whole of `terms.astro`/`privacy.astro`, so
  those files never hardcode a brand and never rot into the previous one.
  Miss it and the site builds perfectly while telling Google it belongs to
  the brand before this one.
- **Brand text colour** — set `BRAND_TEXT` in `src/lib/brandProfile.ts` to
  this brand's **body copy** colour: the one the active `ContentBox*` puts on
  its paragraphs, not the heading or accent colour. Third one-liner in the
  same file, right under `BRAND_NAME`.

  `MainLayout` puts it on `<html>` as an inline `color`, which is the only
  place in the whole site that sets a default text colour — `global.css`
  cannot, being shared between a near-black brand and an ivory one. Anything
  that does not name its own colour inherits from here. **Keep that `color:`
  in the `<html>` style attribute when you retheme the layout.** Drop it and
  every such element renders in the browser's default black; on the dark
  surface most brands use, that is invisible rather than merely wrong, and
  `terms`/`privacy`/`404` name no colours at all by design, so all three go
  blank at once. `verify-build.mjs` fails the build if it goes missing.
- **Contact address and email** — **there is nothing to derive here.**
  `BRAND_ADDRESS` in `src/lib/brandProfile.ts` derives itself from
  `BRAND_NAME`: the brand name hashes into `src/lib/thaiProvinces.ts` (the real
  77 provinces, each with its capital district and postal code) and into a short
  list of desk names, giving a two-line block. `BRAND_ADDRESS.email` comes from
  the same hash — a mailbox name (`support`/`contact`/`info`/`service`/`help`)
  at the host taken from `site:` in `astro.config.mjs`, so it follows the domain
  on its own and cannot point at a previous brand's. Setting `BRAND_NAME` at the
  top of this phase has already set all of it. Do not hand-write either, and do
  not "fix" the derivation to keep a previous value.

  **The mailbox is not routed anywhere, and that is the owner's decision**
  (2026-08-05): the line is there to be read, not written to, the same way the
  address is there to be read and not visited. LINE remains the channel that
  actually reaches a human, and it is on the page twice plus in the footer.
  So do not raise it every rebrand, do not set up mail routing unasked, and do
  not drop the line because it "doesn't work" — it is doing what it was asked
  to do.

  **Two places render it, and only two:** `/contact-us` (under the image, above
  the buttons) and the **active footer**, which puts it on every page. Both read
  the same export — never retype the lines into either one.

  That derivation **is** the safety property: an address pinned to anything
  other than `BRAND_NAME` would survive a rebrand that changed the name, and
  ship the previous brand's location on the new domain. `verify-build.mjs`
  fails the build if the export stops referencing `BRAND_NAME`.

  It is deliberately **district-level, with no house number, soi or street**.
  A fabricated street address has a real chance of naming premises that belong
  to someone — a district and a postal code name an administrative area and
  cannot. Do not add a street line, a building name, or a map link, and do not
  extend `thaiProvinces.ts` down to tambon level.

  The two literals above it, `ADDRESS_OWNER` and `ADDRESS_LINES`, are the
  override for the day a brand has a **real registered address**. Fill both in
  — `ADDRESS_OWNER` takes this brand's `BRAND_NAME` verbatim — and the block
  switches to those lines and relabels itself
  `ที่อยู่จดทะเบียนบริษัท`. Use them **only** for an address the operator
  actually gave you in the prompt. Left over from an earlier brand they are
  inert, because `ADDRESS_OWNER` will not match the new `BRAND_NAME`.

  **Visible text only, never structured data.** Do not pass it to
  `pageGraph`, do not add `address`/`PostalAddress` to `src/lib/schema.ts`,
  do not put it in a `<meta>`. The generated one names a locality nobody has
  verified, and an operator-supplied registered address repeated across ~30
  unrelated brand domains is a machine-readable join key — the same thing the
  `sameAs` ban exists to prevent. `verify-build.mjs` fails the build on any
  address vocabulary (`PostalAddress`, `addressLocality`, `postalCode`, …)
  inside a JSON-LD block. The email is under the same rule — no `email:` in
  `pageGraph`, no `ContactPoint.email`.

  Because the footer carries it, an `<address>` on every page is now expected
  and is no longer an error. What replaced that check is stricter about the
  thing that actually goes wrong: **every rendered `<address>` must contain the
  current `BRAND_NAME`, and any email inside it must be at the host in `site:`**.
  A block left over from the previous brand fails the build on both counts.

**Read the previous brand's picks from git, in one command.** They are in the
code that shipped, which is the authoritative record — not in any log someone
had to remember to write:

```sh
git show HEAD:src/layouts/MainLayout.astro | grep -E 'components/(Navbar|Footer)'
git show HEAD:src/pages/index.astro | grep -E 'from "\.\./components/'
```

If a family genuinely has no better-fitting alternative for this brand's
mood and you must reuse the previous variant, **say so with the reason in the
summary you give the operator at the end** — don't silently leave the old pick
in place. The default expectation on every rebrand is: different navbar,
different footer, different announcement, different winners feed, and a
visibly different ContentBox shape-mix than the brand before.

For every family, two things before wiring a new variant in:
1. **Retheme it first.** These variants ship in whatever color family
   a past brand used (often purple or emerald green) — grep-check with
   `grep -rln "ComponentName" src/pages/` that no *other* page already
   uses it (if none, it's safe to retheme in place), then swap its hue
   to the current brand's palette exactly like Phase 3, before dropping
   it into `index.astro` or `MainLayout.astro`.
2. **Check its heading tags before use**, same rule as the heading-tags
   note above — some variants (e.g. a `SevenThree*FloatingBadge`'s
   `titleleft`/`titleright`) hardcode a different level than others.
   Normalize to match the docx's level for every variant you introduce,
   not just the ones you already had.
3. **Test any `*FloatingBadge` variant with a full-sentence docx
   heading before trusting it, not a short placeholder title.** These
   variants render their `title` inside a `position: absolute`,
   horizontally-centered pill badge with no width cap — a past run
   found every `FloatingBadge` file (`ContentBox`, `ContentBoxTwo`,
   `ContentBox3Three`, `ContentBoxSevenThree`) shipped with
   `whitespace-nowrap` on that badge, which was invisible in a desktop
   check but blew the badge past the viewport width on mobile the
   moment the title was a real docx sentence instead of a 2-3 word
   placeholder — cutting text off and forcing the whole page into
   horizontal scroll (no `<body>` `overflow-x: hidden` existed to
   contain it either). Before using any `*FloatingBadge` variant, grep
   it for `whitespace-nowrap` on the title badge and replace with a
   width cap (e.g. `w-[92%] max-w-2xl`) plus `text-center` so long
   titles wrap instead of overflowing, and confirm `MainLayout.astro`
   still has `overflow-x: hidden` on `html, body` as a second line of
   defense. Verify by checking the actual rendered badge at a mobile
   viewport width with the real (long) title text, not just that the
   build succeeds.

   **Same bug, vertical axis: check the badge doesn't overlap the
   card's own content once it wraps to 2 lines.** All three
   `*FloatingBadge` files position the title as `absolute -top-6`
   inside a card whose top padding (`pt-12`/`pt-14`/`pt-16`/`pt-18`) was
   sized for a *short, one-line* title. Do the arithmetic before
   trusting it: badge height ≈ (line-height × number of wrapped lines)
   + vertical padding + border, and its bottom edge sits at
   `badge height − 24px` (the `-top-6` offset) measured from the card's
   top. If that number is ≥ the card's `pt-*` value, the badge visually
   overlaps the slot content below it — this actually happened with a
   real two-line docx H2 title (`ContentBoxSevenThreeFloatingBadge`
   only reserved `pt-12`/48px; a 2-line mobile-size title came out to
   ~48-72px, i.e. zero or negative clearance) and was fixed by bumping
   the padding (`pt-12`→`pt-16`, `pt-14`→`pt-18` across all three
   `*FloatingBadge` files, kept in sync). Don't just eyeball a desktop
   screenshot with the badge on one line — resize to a narrow mobile
   width with the *actual* long title so it wraps, and confirm there's
   visible daylight between the badge's bottom border and the card's
   inner content.

**Keeping DOM depth shallow when rethemeing a ContentBox variant —
hoist redundant slot-wrapper `<div>`s, don't add new ones.** These
templates aim for shallow, HTML5-semantic markup (`section` → `article`
→ heading/content) for SEO; a repeated wrapper pattern quietly adds a
dead nesting level. In every *multi-column* variant (`*SevenThree*`,
`*3Three*`) each column is
`<article class="flex … gap-N"> <h2>…</h2> <div class="text-…"><slot/></div> </article>`
— that inner `<div>` exists only to carry **inheritable** text classes
(font-size / `leading-*` / text color), so it's a removable level: move
those classes onto the `<article>` and delete the `<div>`, letting the
slot render as a direct child. This is a *safe / zero-visual-change*
edit **only** when you handle the one property that leaks to the sibling
heading:
- Headings here set their own size/weight/color but **not**
  `line-height`, so a `leading-relaxed` hoisted onto the `<article>`
  would leak into the `<h2>` (Tailwind's `html` sets `line-height: 1.5`,
  so the heading currently renders at 1.5). Neutralize the leak by
  adding `leading-normal` (= 1.5, a genuine no-op) to every heading that
  is a flex-sibling of the hoisted slot. Confirm in the Phase 5 build
  (don't build now) by grepping `dist/index.html` that the `<article>`
  now carries the text classes and the wrapper `<div>` is gone.
- **House rule that makes all of this safe: a consumer passes exactly
  ONE element per slot.** Every page currently does
  (`<div slot="right"><p>…</p></div>`, `<p slot="left">…</p>`). Because
  the flattened column is a `gap-N` flex container, injecting *two*
  block children straight into a slot would put a gap between them and
  shift spacing. If a section genuinely needs multiple blocks, wrap them
  yourself in one `<div>` — do not pass siblings into the slot, and do
  not "fix" it by re-adding a wrapper inside the component.

**The single-slot variants are ALREADY flattened too — keep them that
way; do not re-add a wrapper `<div>`.** (`ContentBox`, `*Premium`,
`*CyberCut`, `*FloatingBadge`, `*Huay`, `*Neumorphism`.) These used to
carry a `relative z-10` content wrapper so text painted *above* the
decorative `absolute` aura/corner layers in the card, and this skill used
to say they were unflattenable for that reason. That was solved on
2026-07-26 (CASHOT123) with a cheaper fix than `::before`/`::after`:

- put **`isolate`** (`isolation: isolate`) on the card, and
- give each decorative `absolute` layer **`-z-10`**.

A negative-z-index child paints *after* its stacking context's own
background but *before* in-flow content, so the decoration still sits on
the card yet can never cover the text — no wrapper needed. **`isolate` is
what makes this sound**: several of these cards happen to have
`backdrop-blur-*`, which already creates a stacking context, but relying
on that silently breaks the day someone removes the blur. Declare the
stacking context explicitly.

Then hoist the wrapper's text classes onto the card and delete it. **One
gotcha when hoisting a text colour:** the card usually already has its
own (`text-white/90`). Adding a second colour class of equal specificity
makes the winner depend on the order Tailwind happens to emit them —
**replace** the card's colour rather than adding alongside it.

**The only wrappers that must stay** are ones doing real layout, not
carrying inheritable text classes — as of 2026-07-26 exactly three:
`ContentBoxSpecial` ×2 (the wrapper is a flex sibling of the icon box;
deleting it turns each `<p>` into its own flex item beside the icon) and
`ContentBoxTwoCyberCut` ×1 (its intro-slot wrapper carries a real `mb-8`
and sits next to the grid, so it can't be hoisted onto the card).

All 25 `ContentBox*` files were swept on 2026-07-26.

**House style for body copy inside any content box — headings may be
centered, paragraphs are always flush left at `text-base`.** Set on
2026-07-26 and applied across all 25 `ContentBox*` files; hold it on
every rebrand:

- The element carrying the slot gets **`text-left text-base
  leading-relaxed <colour>`**. No `text-sm`, no `text-lg` for body prose.
- A heading may keep `text-center` (e.g. `ContentBoxNeumorphism`'s
  `<header>`), but put the centering **on the header/heading itself, not
  on the card or `<section>`** — `text-center` on an ancestor inherits
  straight into the slot and centers the paragraph too. That exact bug
  shipped in `ContentBoxNeumorphism` and `ContentBoxHuay`.
- **Don't narrow paragraphs with `mx-auto max-w-4xl` / `max-w-5xl` in
  the page.** The card already caps its own width; the extra cap makes
  the text stop lining up with its heading and reads as a stray indent.
  Pages have shipped this three times — grep `src/pages/*.astro` for
  `<p class="[^"]*\(mx-auto\|max-w-\)` before calling a rebrand done.
- Genuinely centered UI *labels* are fine and out of scope for this rule
  — provider-tile captions, section header lines, stat/score chips.

When a docx has many sections (6+), pick a *different* `ContentBox*`
variant for several of them so the page has rhythm instead of eight
identical rounded cards in a row.

**Use the `ContentBoxSevenThree*` (image+text) family SPARINGLY — at
most TWICE per rebrand, ONCE if the docx is short.** The point of a
SevenThree block is to bring *one* image alongside text; it is NOT the
default section shape, and you do NOT need to give every slide its own
SevenThree. Hard limit: **2 `ContentBoxSevenThree*` blocks per rebrand**
(counting the whole family — plain/`*Premium`/`*CyberCut`/
`*Neumorphism`/etc. together). If the brand's docx has only a few
sections, use it **once**. Every other docx section should lean on
**single-column `ContentBox*` and two-column `ContentBoxTwo*`** instead
— those carry the bulk of the page.

**HARD RULE — `slide*` / promotion images may appear ONLY inside a
`ContentBoxSevenThree*` block, nowhere else.** That image+text layout is the
only place a slide/promotion image looks right, so **never** drop a slide
into a plain `ContentBox`, a bare/full-width `<img>` or strip, a card grid,
or any other component. Because SevenThree is capped at 2 per rebrand (rule
above), at most **2 slides are ever used** — if a slide has no SevenThree
home, or you've already used your 2 SevenThree blocks, **leave that slide
unused**; do not relocate it into another box just to place it.

**Pick exactly the 2 (or 1) `slide*` images that best illustrate their
sections for those SevenThree blocks; the rest of the slides can go
unused.** The image pool for SevenThree is the **`slide*` files only**
(`banner1` is the hero; `banner2/3/4` are single-column `ContentBox`
inline illustrations — see Phase 1, they do NOT go in a SevenThree
column). Read the slides with `Read`, choose the 2 whose drawn content
maps cleanly onto a docx section (e.g. a certification/SSL image → the
"licensed/standards" section, a speed-test image → the "performance
test" section), and don't feel obliged to place all four — leaving 2
slides unused is expected and fine. Say which slides you used and which you
left out in the closing summary.

**Every docx heading must survive, in document order, before you touch
theming.** Before writing a single line of `index.astro`, list out
*all* H1/H2/H3 lines from the Phase 1 extraction as a numbered
checklist (not just the ones that obviously map to an existing slot).
This catches two failure modes a past run actually hit:
- **Dropped sections.** It's easy to map the 5-6 headings that map
  cleanly onto existing slots and quietly skip the 2-3 that don't have
  an obvious home (e.g. a "site strengths / usage results" heading, or
  a "which providers are covered" heading with no dedicated slot).
  Every heading gets its own titled block with the **full paragraph
  text that follows it in the docx** — never just the heading with no
  body, and never a summarized/merged version that quietly folds two
  docx paragraphs into one. If no existing component slot fits, reuse
  a plain `ContentBox` with a manual `<h2>` + `<p>` rather than
  dropping the section.
- **Reordered sections.** Don't let the *pre-existing* component order
  in `index.astro` (hero → login widget → carousel → reviews → ...)
  dictate where docx content lands. Walk the docx top to bottom and
  place each section's `ContentBox`/etc. in that same order; only
  *then* slot in the non-docx UI widgets (login form, image carousel,
  review cards, wallet/signup blurbs) around the docx content — at the
  very start (before section 1) or the very end (after the last docx
  section), not spliced between two docx sections. If a supporting
  component (provider grid, live-winners feed, RTP/volatility 3-col)
  visually belongs to one specific docx section, place it immediately
  after that section's `ContentBox`, not wherever it happened to sit
  in the old file.

**Only the article content may produce a heading. Chrome may not — at
any level.** Every `<h1>`/`<h2>`/`<h3>` that survives to the rendered
page must trace back to a heading in the docx (or to a sanctioned H3
sub-point, below). Everything that is *furniture* rather than article —
navbar, footer, announcement ticker, live-winners feed, RTP/volatility
widget, the login/register box, floating badges, carousel captions,
card and column labels, "ยินดีต้อนรับ"-style greetings — renders its
label as a `<p>` or `<span>` carrying the same classes, never as a
heading. Where the label named a region for assistive tech, move that
job to `aria-label` on the container; the visual result is identical
because the size and weight live in the classes, not in the tag.

Two separate things go wrong when chrome takes a heading, which is why
this rule is about *existence* and the one below is only about level:

- **The Phase 5 heading inventory stops meaning anything.** That check
  is a by-hand diff of the page's h1/h2/h3 against the docx checklist.
  A UI label sitting in the h2 list makes the counts disagree with the
  brief on every future rebrand, and the reflex is to "fix" the count by
  editing the checklist — so one stray `<h2>` quietly retires the check
  that would have caught the next real dropped section.
- **It is a content claim with no content behind it.** A heading tells a
  crawler a section of the document starts here and this names it. On a
  ticker or a card label that is simply false, and it is false on every
  page the component appears on, not just the one being reviewed.

The `<h1>` case is worse than the rest and has bitten this template
before: a navbar variant carried an `<h1>` in its logo fallback
(found on `NavbarCyber`, 2026-08-03), which is **two** `<h1>` on the
homepage and, on every sub-page, a *wrong* one outranking that page's
real title. `verify-build.mjs` fails the build for a second `<h1>` on
any indexable page, so this shows up as a red build rather than a
silent SEO loss — do not "fix" it by deleting the page's real `<h1>`.

Prop-driven headings are not chrome and are fine: `Faq*`'s `title`,
`ContentBoxSevenThree*`'s `titleleft`/`rightHeading` and the rest all
receive their text from `index.astro`, i.e. from the docx. The test is
where the words come from, not which file the tag is written in. A
hardcoded Thai string inside a component is the tell.

**How to check, and it is not by reading `index.astro`.** Grep every
component that `index.astro` and `MainLayout.astro` import:

```sh
grep -n '<h[1-6]' src/components/<each in-use component>.astro
```

For each hit, confirm the text is interpolated from a prop. Anything
hardcoded gets downgraded **inside that component**, keeping its
classes — and if the component is also used by another page, check that
page still reads correctly afterwards. The same rule holds for the
sub-pages: their headings come from their own article body, not from
whatever component they hang it on.

**Heading tags: match what the docx actually uses, everywhere.** If
every section in the docx is marked H2 (no H3 sub-headings), every
section title in the rendered page must be an `<h2>` — not just in the
`ContentBox`/`ContentBox3Three` markup you write by hand, but also
inside any shared component you call into. Several of this template's
components hardcode a lower heading level for their title prop (e.g. a
"seven-three" image block's `titleright` rendering as `<h3>`, a
provider-grid card name rendering as `<h3>`, a footer column heading
rendering as `<h3>`) — these render on the final page even though
you never typed `<h3>` yourself. Grep every component `index.astro`
touches for `<h[1-6]` and normalize each one to match the docx's
actual heading level before calling the page done; don't stop at
grepping `index.astro`'s own markup. (Only keep a real level
*hierarchy* — e.g. H1 page title → H2 section → H3 sub-item — if the
docx itself has that nested structure; if it's flat H1+H2 only,
flatten the page to match.)

**The one sanctioned exception to "flatten everything to H2": a docx
section with a short bullet-style sub-list under it.** When one docx
H2 section's body isn't just a paragraph but 2-4 short sub-points
(each with its own short label, e.g. "feature A / feature B / feature
C" under one "features" heading), don't hand-roll a repeated
icon-card `<div>` block with its own `<h2>` per point — that both
breaks the one-H2-per-docx-heading rule and duplicates markup. Use
`src/components/FeatureHighlights.astro`: pass an `items` prop
(`{ icon, title, description, accent?: "gold" | "blue" }[]`), and it
renders each point's `title` as an `<h3>` — the section's own H2
stays the only H2, the sub-points become real H3 children under it.
This is the only place a docx-driven page should have an `<h3>` at
all; if you find yourself wanting more than one heading level below a
section for the same content, that's a sign to reconsider the mapping,
not to add another exception. Wire `FeatureHighlights` into
`index.astro` the same way as any other family component (import it,
pass the docx's sub-points as `items`) whenever a docx section fits
this shape — don't reinvent the icon-card markup inline again.

**Don't leave HTML comments (`<!-- … -->`) in `index.astro`, any page,
or any component that renders on the page.** Astro does *not* strip
`<!-- -->` comments — they ship verbatim into the built HTML, so
section-label breadcrumbs like `<!-- H1: … -->` / `<!-- H2: ทางเข้า … -->`
leak the docx outline (and the old brand name) into production output.
Use the numbered docx heading checklist and the `as="h2"`/`title=` props
themselves as your in-editor markers instead of comment labels; the
semantic tags already say what each block is. This applies to
JS/frontmatter comments only in the sense that those *are* stripped —
the hazard is specifically the HTML-comment syntax in the template body.

**This isn't only about markup you write fresh — the shared components
already carry old `<!-- … -->` labels** (decorative-layer notes like
`<!-- แสงพื้นหลัง -->`, `<!-- Section Header -->`, column markers), and
every one rendered on the page ships to output. When you do the Phase 3
full-file retheme of a component, strip its HTML comments in the same
pass. Scope this to the components the live page actually renders, built
*recursively* (an import of an import — e.g. `LoginRtpSection` →
`ContentBoxTwo` — still renders), and to the active navbar/footer that
`MainLayout.astro` points at (grep its `Navbar*`/`Footer*` imports) —
**not** the inventory siblings that aren't wired in. Find them with
`grep -rn '<!--' src/components src/layouts` then filter to the rendered
set. Verify in Phase 5 with `grep -c '<!--' dist/index.html` (expect 0).
Applied on 2026-07-15 for HENGJUD365: cleaned `ContentBox`,
`ContentBoxSevenThree`, `Announcement6`, `ProviderGrid`,
`ReviewCardSumo2` (the 5 rendered components that had comments) and left
`Navbar`/`Footer`/`NavbarStyle*`/`LatestWinnersPremium`/old
`ReviewCardSumo` untouched as inventory.

## Phase 3 — Retheme every component index.astro touches

Identify the old brand's dominant Tailwind color family (grep the
component tree for a repeated hue like `red-` or `rose-`) and the old
brand name string. For every component actually rendered from
`index.astro` (plus the shared layout chrome — `MainLayout.astro`, the
active `Navbar*`/`Footer*`/`Navfoot.astro`), do a full-file `Write`
rewrite (cleaner than dozens of tiny edits) that:
- swaps every occurrence of the old hue family to the new palette's
  matching Tailwind shade number (`red-600` → `cyan-600`, `red-950` →
  `blue-950`, etc.) and matching `rgba(...)` glow values
- leaves unrelated semantic colors alone (LINE green `#00B900`, green
  "live"/success indicators, real bank brand colors) — only the old
  brand's *identity* color should move
- replaces the old brand name in visible text, `alt=`, and any
  hardcoded fallback text (logo fallback headings, footer copyright)

Also grep the whole `src/` tree for the old brand name after this pass.
Hits inside **inventory components** that `index.astro` doesn't render
(unused `Navbar*`/`Footer*`/`Announcement*`/`Faq*` siblings, etc.) are
expected drift — leave them. But hits inside the **other real pages**
(`src/pages/*.astro`) are **in scope and must be fixed in the same
rebrand — see the Phase 4.5 sweep below.** Don't defer them as "a
separate ask"; a half-rebranded site where `/promotion` or `/login`
still shows the previous brand is a bug the user will bounce back.

## Phase 4.5 — Rebrand EVERY other page, not just `index.astro`

`index.astro` is the biggest page but it is **not** the only one. Once
its edits are done, sweep **every** `src/pages/*.astro` and bring each
onto the new brand — this is mandatory, not optional. (Don't build
between finishing `index.astro` and starting this sweep; the single
Phase 5 build covers all pages at once.) For each page:

1. **Brand name** in `<title>`, `description`, `<h1>`/`ContentBox`
   titles, schema.org `name`/`url`, `alt=` text, and any hardcoded
   logo/brand-identity string (some standalone pages like `login.astro`/
   `register.astro` are full custom HTML with a `.brand-identity` div and
   their own `<style>` block — they don't use `MainLayout`, so they need
   the brand + hue swap done inline, not inherited).
2. **Hue swap** to the new palette — and note the standalone pages often
   theme via **raw hex / `rgba()` in a `<style>` block** (e.g. a CSS var
   misnamed `--brand-red: #2563eb` that's actually the old blue), which a
   tailwind-class grep (`blue-[0-9]`) misses. Grep each page for the old
   brand's hex and `rgba()` glow values too, not just utility classes.
3. **Chrome consistency — make every page's `Announcement*`/navbar/footer
   match `index.astro`.** Pages that share `MainLayout` inherit the
   navbar/footer/hero automatically (you already repointed those in
   Phase 3), but each page imports its **own `Announcement*`** in its
   frontmatter — grep `src/pages/*.astro` for `Announcement` and switch
   every casino/main page to the **same variant `index.astro` uses**
   (e.g. `Announcement6` → `AnnouncementCyber`), so the ticker style +
   message are uniform sitewide. If `index` passes an explicit `message`
   prop, the other pages calling `<Announcement />` bare will fall back
   to that variant's **default** message — make sure that default (which
   you set in Phase 2/3) is the current brand's copy so bare calls match.
4. **Stale-asset check per page** (Phase 4 applies here too — e.g.
   `promotion.astro` hardcodes `slide1-4` imports; confirm the extensions
   exist).
5. **The one sanctioned exception: intentionally-themed sub-sections.**
   Lottery/`หวย` pages (`แนวทาง.astro`, `ตรวจหวย.astro`) run their own
   `Huay` theme (red/gold) + `AnnouncementHuay` on purpose — do **not**
   force them onto the casino brand's hue or `AnnouncementCyber`. Still
   verify they carry **zero** old-brand-name references; only the theme
   is exempt, not the brand name. Note this decision in the closing summary.

### Two pages carry no article body — `/contact-us` and `/ทางเข้า`

Both are **button pages, not articles**: a visitor opens them to press
something, and every paragraph above the buttons pushes them further down.
Their whole body is, in order:

**`contact-us.astro`**

1. the `ContentBox` `title` (the page's single `<h1>`)
2. the LINE image (`src/assets/contact-line.webp`)
3. the `BRAND_ADDRESS` block — lines, then `BRAND_ADDRESS.email` as a
   `mailto:` link underneath
4. the `สมัครสมาชิก` / `เข้าสู่ระบบ` / `ติดต่อผ่าน Line Official` button row

**`ทางเข้า.astro`**

1. the `ContentBox` `title` (the page's single `<h1>`)
2. the two-column `เข้าสู่ระบบ` / `สมัครสมาชิก` button grid

**Write no section headings and no explanatory paragraphs on either.** Not
"ควรเตรียมข้อมูลอะไรก่อนแจ้ง", not "ตรวจ 4 จุดก่อนล็อกอิน", not a PIN/OTP
safety notice — however well-written and however much the previous copy looks
like it belongs.

Where the copy keeps coming from: the docx **SUB-PAGES** section gives these
pages a `Title` and a `Meta` and **never a body**, so any prose you find is
something an earlier rebrand invented and every rebrand since has faithfully
rewritten, each assuming the last one had a reason. It didn't. If the page you
inherit has `<h2>`s and paragraphs, **delete them** — that is a fix, not a scope
overrun.

**Everything else on these pages stays**: the `Announcement`, the buttons and
their icons, `Navfoot`, the `pageGraph` call, the `MainLayout` title and
description. Only the headings and the prose come out. Retheme the buttons to
the new palette as normal.

Give the `<h1>` a title that names what the page **is** — "ทางเข้า
`<BRAND>` เว็บหลัก", "ติดต่อทีมงาน `<BRAND>`". A title that previews an article
("…ต้องตรวจ 4 จุดก่อนล็อกอิน") reads as a broken promise once the article is
gone, and it is the line most likely to tempt the next rebrand into writing the
body back.

Consequence for the Phase 5 inventory: each contributes **`h1×1`, `h2×0`,
`h3×0`**. An `<h2>` on either means this rule was missed.

### `/promotion` is an IMAGE page — about four lines of prose, no more

Asked for on 2026-08-08, after NORWAY89's promotion page shipped a four-section
article. It applies to every rebrand from here on.

The promotion page's content **is the `slide*` artwork**. Each slide already
states its own offer in large type — the bonus, the percentage, the terms — so
prose underneath it re-types what the visitor can already read, in smaller
letters. A visitor opens `/promotion` to see what the promotions *are*, and
every paragraph pushes the grid further down.

Its whole body is, in order:

1. the `ContentBox` `title` (the page's single `<h1>`)
2. **one short intro paragraph — about four lines, and that is the entire prose
   budget for the page**
3. the promo image grid (the `slide*` files, `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`)
4. one `สมัครสมาชิก <BRAND>` button

**Write no section headings.** Not "โบนัสสมาชิกใหม่…", not "โปรฝากประจำวันและ
สิทธิ์คืนยอดเสีย", not "ฝากถอนออโต้และการรับสิทธิ์จากทุกอุปกรณ์" — however
accurate the copy is and however much the page you inherit looks like it wants
them. The intro says what the page holds and that conditions differ per
promotion; the pictures say the rest.

This is the same failure mode as `/contact-us` and `/ทางเข้า` above, and it
arrives the same way: the docx **SUB-PAGES** section gives this page a `Title`
and a `Meta` and **never a body**, so every paragraph on it was invented by some
earlier rebrand and rewritten by every rebrand since. If the page you inherit
has `<h2>`s and seven paragraphs, **delete them down to the one intro** — that
is a fix, not a scope overrun.

Everything else stays: the `Announcement`, the image grid and its `alt` text,
the CTA, `Navfoot`, the `pageGraph` call (keep `primaryImagePath`), the
`MainLayout` title and description. Retheme all of it to the new palette as
normal, and keep writing a real 150–160 character description — the page is
still indexed and still needs to say what it is.

Consequence for the Phase 5 inventory: `/promotion` contributes **`h1×1`,
`h2×0`, `h3×0`**, exactly like the two button pages.

The remaining sub-pages — `/about-us`, `/ทดลองเล่น`, `/บทความ`, `/terms`,
`/privacy` — are the opposite: they *are* articles and their headings come from
their own body, per Phase 5.

### The active footer carries the same contact block

`Footer*` rotates every rebrand, and the block lives in the file, not in
`MainLayout` — so **whichever footer you switch to, port it across**. Resolve
the live one from `MainLayout.astro`'s `import Footer`. Every variant puts an
`<a href="/line">` in a customer-service column; drop this immediately after
that anchor, and add the import to the frontmatter:

```astro
import { BRAND_ADDRESS } from "../lib/brandProfile";
```

```astro
{
  BRAND_ADDRESS.lines.length > 0 && (
    <address aria-label={BRAND_ADDRESS.label} class="mt-2 rounded-xl border border-white/15 bg-black/20 p-4 text-xs leading-relaxed not-italic opacity-90">
      <p class="mb-2 flex items-center gap-2 text-[11px] font-bold tracking-wider uppercase opacity-80">
        <span aria-hidden="true" class="text-sm">📍</span>
        {BRAND_ADDRESS.label}
      </p>
      {BRAND_ADDRESS.lines.map((line) => (
        <span class="block">{line}</span>
      ))}
      {BRAND_ADDRESS.email && (
        <a href={`mailto:${BRAND_ADDRESS.email}`} class="mt-3 inline-flex items-center gap-2 font-bold underline decoration-current/40 underline-offset-4 opacity-90 transition-opacity hover:opacity-100">
          <span aria-hidden="true" class="text-sm">✉️</span>
          {BRAND_ADDRESS.email}
        </a>
      )}
    </address>
  )
}
```

**Paste it verbatim — do not theme it, and do not put a hex value in it.** It
carries no brand colour on purpose: `border-white/15`, `bg-black/20` and
`opacity` over the footer's inherited text colour land correctly on every
variant in the library, which are all dark. Retyping it in this brand's palette
buys nothing and is the exact move that leaves the previous brand's hex behind
next time.

Rules that bite here: the label is a `<p>` or `<span>`, **never a heading**
(chrome may not take a heading tag, and the footer is on every page, so one
`<h2>` there is an `<h2>` sitewide); keep `not-italic`, since browsers italicise
`<address>` by default; and the 📍/✉️ glyphs go in their own
`<span aria-hidden="true">`, never inside the text.

Leaving it out is not a build failure — the check only fires on an address that
names the *wrong* brand — so it is on you to confirm the footer renders it.

**Lottery pages — normally the operator's switch, not yours.** `ตรวจหวย.astro`
and `แนวทาง.astro` are routed only when they sit in `src/pages/`; Astro ignores
`src/pages-disabled/` entirely.

**ส่วนที่ 5 of the uploader now has a toggle for each of them**, alongside
บทความ and เกี่ยวกับเรา. When the rebrand was fired from the uploader the
operator has already decided: the pages are in the right folder and the navbar
and footer links already match. **Check the state, don't re-derive it** — if
`src/pages/` matches what the brand should have, there is nothing to do here.

The keyword rule below is the **fallback for prompts typed straight into Claude
Code**, where no toggle was involved.

⚠️ **Do not assume where they currently are — check.** They are wherever the
*previous* brand left them, and the previous brand may well have been a
lottery site. This is a state you must set every rebrand, in both
directions, not a default you can inherit. (MAHORANLOTTO turned them on;
whatever runs next starts with them in `src/pages/` and both links live in
the navbar.)

Run `ls src/pages/ src/pages-disabled/` and then make reality match the
brand:

**If the rebrand prompt contains the word `เว็บหวย` (or the brand is clearly
a lottery site) — they must end up ON:**
- **Enable the pages** — move `ตรวจหวย.astro` and `แนวทาง.astro` from
  `src/pages-disabled/` into `src/pages/`, so they become the routes
  `/ตรวจหวย` and `/แนวทาง`.
- **Add their menu links to the ACTIVE navbar** — insert
  `{ name: "ตรวจหวย", path: "/ตรวจหวย" }` and
  `{ name: "แนวทาง", path: "/แนวทาง" }` into **both** the desktop and mobile
  link arrays of the active navbar (same edit as the ส่วนที่ 5 created-page
  rule — resolve the active navbar from `MainLayout.astro`'s import, it
  rotates each rebrand).
- Rebrand their copy like any other page (brand name, title, stale assets),
  **but keep their intentional `Huay` theme + `AnnouncementHuay`** per the
  exception above.
**For a non-lottery brand (slot/casino/sport) they must end up OFF — and
turning them off is an action, not an absence of one:**
- **If they are sitting in `src/pages/`, move them back** to
  `src/pages-disabled/`. Left alone, a slot brand ships `/ตรวจหวย` and
  `/แนวทาง` — lottery pages rethemed in slot colours, off-topic for the
  site and thin content Google has no reason to rank.
- **Remove their links from the active navbar AND the active footer.** The
  navbar's desktop *and* mobile arrays, plus the footer's link list — the
  `*Huay` footer carries its own `/ตรวจหวย` and `/แนวทาง` entries under
  "ทางลัดหน้าเว็บ", which is easy to miss because the navbar is the obvious
  place to look. Both rotate each rebrand, so if the new brand picks a
  different navbar/footer the stale links leave with the old ones; if it
  reuses either, they are still there.
  **Grep, don't guess:** `grep -rn "ตรวจหวย\|แนวทาง" src/ --include="*.astro"`
  lists every file still pointing at them. Anything that isn't rendered by the
  current brand is dormant inventory and stays as it is.
- Leave the `*Huay` components themselves alone — they are inventory for the
  next lottery brand, same as every other unused variant.

Record the on/off decision in the closing summary either way.

**`terms.astro` and `privacy.astro` are NOT in that decision.** They ship on
every brand, are never parked, and are never rewritten. They are brand-neutral
by construction — every brand-specific word in them comes from `BRAND_NAME`, so
setting that one line retitles both pages. Every footer variant links to them,
and `tools/verify-build.mjs` fails the build if either route is missing, so
parking one turns into a red build rather than a pair of dead legal links.
Do not add them to the uploader's `PRESET_PAGES`: that registry is a set of
on/off toggles, and these have no "off".

**Both render their body through `ContentBox.astro`, and must keep doing so**
(asked for on 2026-08-01, after MIRACLE55 shipped them as bare text on the
background while every other page was in boxes). Each section is one
`<ContentBox as="h2" title={…}>`; the page title is one `<ContentBox as="h1">`.

Two rules make that survive a rebrand, and both are easy to break by being
helpful:

- **Nothing inside those boxes may name a colour.** `ContentBox`'s own wrapper
  sets the text colour and the paragraphs inherit it, which is the only reason
  these pages stay brand-neutral after being wrapped. Copying index's
  `class="text-[#…]"` onto the paragraphs would hardcode this brand's palette
  into a file no future rebrand opens.
- **`ContentBox.astro` specifically — never the variant `index.astro` picked
  this round.** A permanent page cannot follow a rotation it does not know
  about. This pins `ContentBox` as always-live, which costs nothing: it is
  already imported by two or more pages, so the shared-chrome rule in Step P1
  already puts it in the set you retheme before fan-out. Just do not let it
  fall out of that set — if `index.astro` stops using `ContentBox`, terms and
  privacy still do, and it still needs this brand's colours.

**`privacy.astro` describes what the built site actually does, and that is the
one thing in it that can go stale.** Today the build is static with no
analytics, no tracking pixel, no cookie banner and no form that posts anywhere
— login and register are links to an external operator — and the page says so.
A privacy policy claiming collection the site does not perform is worse than
none. If a brand ever adds analytics, a pixel or a real form, that page has to
change in the same pass.

**`public/` belongs to nobody, so claim it explicitly.** Nothing in `public/`
is reached by the "retheme the components the layout imports" sweep, and the
uploader only writes the icon sizes it knows about — `favicon.ico`,
`favicon.svg`, `favicon-96x96.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png`,
`web-app-manifest-192/512`. Anything else there is from whichever brand last
put it there. Four SUMOHENG icons (`favicon-16x16`, `favicon-32x32`,
`android-chrome-192x192`, `android-chrome-512x512`) rode along on every brand
for a week that way, 286 kB of another brand's logo on a fixed public path.
`verify-build.mjs` now fails the build on a sized icon nothing links, so this
particular leak cannot come back — but `site.webmanifest` still needs its
`name`, `short_name` and `theme_color` set by hand every round.

**Do not drop the `?v=` from the icon links in `MainLayout`.** They read
`` href={`/favicon.svg?v=${iconVersion}`} `` and friends. The icon *paths* are
identical on every brand while the *bytes* change, which is the one case a
browser's favicon cache holds hardest — without the query the tab keeps showing
the previous brand's logo no matter how correct the files are. `iconVersion`
comes from `BRAND_NAME`, so it updates itself.

**Preset pages (`บทความ.astro`, `about-us.astro`) follow the same rule, with a
different trigger.** They are created by the uploader's ส่วนที่ 5 toggle, not by
a keyword, and like the lottery pages nothing removes them again — so a page one
brand asked for keeps shipping on every brand after it, carrying that first
brand's article.

Decide per rebrand, and **check `src/pages/` rather than assuming a clean
slate**:

- **Asked for this round** — it holds a `TODO(rebrand)` placeholder body, freshly
  scaffolded. Fill it from the docx per Phase 4.5. (Already the rule above.)
- **Present with real content and the operator did not ask for it** — that is
  last brand's page. Its article is about a different client's site, so it must
  not ship. **Move it to `src/pages-disabled/` and strip its nav link. Never
  delete it** — someone wrote that page, and parking costs nothing.
- **Kept on for this brand deliberately** — treat it as any other sub-page and
  rebrand its copy in full. A leftover that slipped through is caught by the
  Phase 5 sweep anyway: the old brand name is still in its text.

> The uploader understands parked pages. `createPage()` looks in
> `src/pages-disabled/` before scaffolding, so switching a page back on **moves
> the file back** instead of creating a second copy of the same filename in two
> directories — and ส่วนที่ 5 labels it `ปิดอยู่ — เปิดกลับได้` rather than
> `จะสร้างใหม่`. Park pages there and nowhere else, or that link breaks.

**The `tools/rebrand-uploader` "ส่วนที่ 4 — Title/Meta หน้าย่อย" is an
OPTIONAL shortcut, NOT a replacement for this phase.** The uploader can
parse a `SUB-PAGES (Title & Meta Description)` section out of the brand's
`content.docx` — when that section exists, its `[หัวข้อ]` headings use the
exact Thai page names (`[โปรโมชั่น]`/`[ติดต่อเรา]`/`[ทดลองเล่น]`/`[ทางเข้า]`)
with `Title:`/`Meta:` lines, and an operator may have already set those 4
pages' `<MainLayout title/description>` before handing the rebrand to you.
**If the docx has NO such section (the common case so far — GROW268 and
earlier had none), nothing special happens and nothing is blocked: you
still set every page's `<title>`/`description` here exactly as always,
inferring them from the docx's main title/H1/H2 the same way you did for
GROW268.**

**Length rule for any `description` you write yourself: 150–160
characters.** A description the brief supplies is used **verbatim, at
whatever length it arrives** — do not pad it, do not top it up to 150,
do not reach into the H1/H2 for extra clauses. This covers a
`content.txt` written by `tools/site-import.mjs` exactly as it covers a
hand-written `content.docx`: the `Description` line under the old site's
own meta tag is the brand's copy, not a draft to improve. Short brief descriptions
are the norm, not the exception (ANDAMAN168 134, NORWAY89 136,
WINSIAM88 142), and `verify-build` deliberately does not enforce its
150-character floor on the home page for exactly this reason, so a
134-character home description is a passing build, not something to
fix. Upper bounds still bind everywhere — the ones you infer have run long
every time: on UFAG8 the four sub-pages came out at 234 / 251 / 270 /
337 characters, roughly double, because each one kept appending another
clause (`ทั้งแฮนดิแคป สูง–ต่ำ และ 1X2`, `บิลเดี่ยวกับบิลสเต็ป`, …) until
the whole page outline was in the tag. Google truncates around 155, so
everything past that is invisible; write one sentence that says what the
page is for and stop. Same target for the home page.

Count **characters, not bytes** — Thai is 3 bytes per character in UTF-8,
so `wc -c` reads about 3× the real length and will send you chasing a
problem that is not there. Check the built output, since that is what
ships:

```sh
grep -o '<meta name="description" content="[^"]*"' dist/**/*.html |
  while read -r l; do printf '%s %s\n' "$(printf '%s' "$l" | wc -m)" "$l"; done
```

Either way this full phase runs — the sweep for brand name,
hue, chrome consistency, and stale assets across *every* `src/pages/*.astro`
is mandatory regardless of whether the uploader pre-filled the 4 sub-page
titles. (The uploader anchors only on the `<MainLayout>` tag and leaves
`<ContentBox>` titles alone, so re-setting a title here never conflicts
with what it may have written.)

**The uploader's "ส่วนที่ 5 — สร้างหน้าเพิ่ม (ตัวเลือก)" can scaffold NEW
pages before you start.** An operator may toggle on one of the preset extra
pages (`บทความ.astro` and `about-us.astro`; `register.astro`/`login.astro` are
also toggles but behave differently — see below) in the uploader. When
they do, the tool creates that `src/pages/*.astro` for real — cloning an
existing sub-page's frontmatter (so it inherits the brand's current
`Announcement*`/`ContentBox*` variants) — but leaves the **body as a blank
placeholder**: a `<ContentBox>` holding an HTML comment
`<!-- TODO(rebrand): … -->` plus a "อยู่ระหว่างปรับปรุงเนื้อหา" line.
**Title/Meta are optional in the tool**, so when the operator left them blank
the page ships with a throwaway default title (the page label) and a
`(อยู่ระหว่างจัดทำเนื้อหา)` description — those are placeholders for you, not
final copy. **These pages are in scope for this phase like any other
`src/pages/*.astro`, and writing their content is YOUR job, not the tool's**
(the uploader has no AI — it only scaffolds). For each (grep `src/pages` for
`TODO(rebrand)` to find them — none may exist, that's fine):
1. **Write a real ~1-paragraph article** for that page inside its `<ContentBox>`
   (keep using `ContentBox`/the brand's box variant), built from the
   `content.docx` — replacing the TODO comment + the "อยู่ระหว่างปรับปรุงเนื้อหา"
   placeholder entirely. A `บทความ` page especially should read as genuine copy,
   not a stub.
2. **Set real `<MainLayout title/description>`** with the brand name (overwrite
   the tool's default label/`(อยู่ระหว่างจัดทำเนื้อหา)` placeholder), same as
   item 1 of this phase.
3. Run the same brand-name / hue / chrome / stale-asset sweep on it.

**`register.astro` and `login.astro` are a different kind of preset — button
pages, not articles.** Their toggle converts the interstitial that auto-forwards
to the affiliate link into a real page whose only content is one button to that
same destination, so the route becomes indexable instead of reading as a sneaky
redirect. Spot them by `const targetUrl` in the frontmatter next to a
`TODO(rebrand)` comment. On these:

- **Never write an article, and never add an `<h2>`.** One `<h1>` from
  `<ContentBox as="h1">` and one button — the same rule `/contact-us` and
  `/ทางเข้า` follow.
- **Never edit `targetUrl`.** It is this brand's affiliate link, carried over
  from the page you replaced. Restyle the button, leave the destination and its
  `rel="nofollow sponsored"` alone.
- **Title and description are now load-bearing.** These pages used to be
  `noindex`; as button pages they are indexed, so `verify-build` holds their
  description to 150–160 characters like any other page. The tool carries over
  the old interstitial's copy as a starting point, and that copy still describes
  an automatic redirect that no longer happens — rewrite both.
- Recolour the button to the palette. The tool clones its classes from whichever
  matching button `/ทางเข้า` already has, so it is usually right already; if
  `/ทางเข้า` had no such button the class falls back to a neutral grey and the
  TODO comment says so.
- **`CtaRedirect.astro` is rendered on both of these pages, so it is in scope
  for the retheme.** It is the loading animation the interstitial used to show
  on its way to the affiliate link — an orb, two counter-rotating rings and the
  brand name — now triggered by the click instead of by page load, so the page
  itself stays a real page. Nothing else in the repo renders it, which means an
  un-rethemed copy ships the **previous** brand's hues on the one screen a
  visitor sees at the moment they convert. Its scoped `<style>` is the only
  place to change: swap the hexes for the palette's primary, its light and deep
  shades, the second hue on `.ring-2`, and the panel/backdrop surface. Leave the
  markup, the timings and the `<script>` alone — `data-cta-redirect` on the
  anchor is what the script binds to, and the brand name comes from
  `BRAND_NAME` on its own.
- **`ทางเข้า` leaves the menu while either toggle is on, by design.** That page
  exists only to offer เข้าสู่ระบบ and สมัครสมาชิก, so once those two are menu
  entries themselves it is a third link to the same two places. The page stays
  routed and indexed — only its menu entry goes, and switching the last cta
  toggle back off restores it with its original icon. Do not re-add it by hand,
  and do not delete `src/pages/ทางเข้า.astro`.

The uploader also tries to add the page's `{ name, path }`
to the **active navbar's** link arrays (both desktop + mobile) on a
best-effort basis — but it only understands the inline
`[ {…path…} ].map(` array shape. If the active navbar variant uses a
different markup (or the tool logged a `navbar: …` warning), the link won't
be there: **grep the active navbar for the new page's `path:` and, if
missing, add `{ name, path }` to both arrays yourself** (same edit you'd make
when rotating navbar variants in Phase 2/3). A newly created page whose route
isn't linked in the menu is the failure mode to watch for.

Verify in Phase 5 by grepping **all** of `dist/` (not just
`dist/index.html`) for the old brand name → must be 0 across every page.
When a preset page was scaffolded, also confirm **zero** `TODO(rebrand)` /
"อยู่ระหว่างปรับปรุงเนื้อหา" / "อยู่ระหว่างจัดทำเนื้อหา" placeholders survive into
`dist/`, that the page now carries a real article + brand-name title, and that
the new page's route appears in the rendered navbar.

**Components can be nested — don't stop at grepping `index.astro`'s own
JSX.** Some sections get extracted into their own wrapper component
that itself imports and renders another shared component (e.g.
`LoginRtpSection.astro` wraps `ContentBoxTwo.astro` — `index.astro`
only ever sees `<LoginRtpSection />`, never `ContentBoxTwo` directly).
A shallow `grep "<ComponentName" src/pages/index.astro` will miss
`ContentBoxTwo` entirely in that case. Build the "every component
`index.astro` touches" list recursively: for each component
`index.astro` imports, also grep *that file* for further
`import ... from "./..."` components it renders, and repeat, before
doing the hue/brand-name sweep in this phase or the verification pass
in Phase 5.

**Two import path shapes — a grep for only one of them lies.** Pages
import as `from "../components/X.astro"`, but a component importing a
sibling writes `from "./X.astro"`. So an "is this component used?" check
built on `grep -rl "components/X.astro"` reports **inventory** for
anything reached only from another component — on 2026-07-26 that
wrongly cleared `ContentBoxTwo` (used by `LoginRtpSection`) as unused.
Match the **bare filename** instead:

```bash
grep -rl "\bX\.astro" src/pages/ src/components/
```

This matters beyond bookkeeping: "rendered vs inventory" decides which
files get the retheme, and mislabelling a live component as inventory
ships the previous brand's colours to production.

### Images: always tell Astro how big the picture is drawn

`<Image>`/`<Picture>` with no `widths` and no `sizes` ships the **source file**.
Not a resized copy — the original. The logo went out at 1024x481 and 73,938
bytes into a box drawn about 110x50 px; with `widths={[110, 220, 330]}` and
`sizes="110px"` the 1x candidate is 2,700 bytes.

`sizes` describes how wide the image is **drawn**, not how wide you want the
file. The hero banner said `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 412px, 100vw"` while being
drawn full-bleed, so a DPR-2 phone needed 824 px, found no candidate between 768
and 1900, and downloaded the 1900w file — 97 KB for a 412 px-wide slot. It is
`sizes="100vw"` with candidates at 412/640/828/1024/1280/1600/1900 now, and that
phone gets 32 KB. This is the LCP element on every page; get it wrong and
nothing else you do to the page matters much.

Only the LCP image gets `loading="eager" fetchpriority="high"`. The wallpaper
had `loading="eager" decoding="sync"` and was competing with it.

**og:image** comes from `src/assets/og.png`, which the uploader writes at
1200x630 from the slide1 upload (letterboxed on a colour sampled from the
artwork — a centre crop of a square promo banner cuts the brand name off the
top). `MainLayout` falls back to slide1 for brands launched before this existed.
Do not point `og:image` at an imported asset's `.src`: that is the untouched
original, and it was shipping a 190 KB PNG to be read by a meta tag.

**`{/* comments */}` cannot sit next to a tag inside a ternary branch.** Half of
these tags are one branch of `mainLogo ? (…) : (…)`, and adding a comment beside
one makes the branch two expressions — the build fails with `Expected ")" but
found "$$render"`, pointing at a line some distance away. Put the note in the
frontmatter.

### Accessibility rules the build now enforces

All five are **errors** in `tools/verify-build.mjs`, so a rebrand that
reintroduces one fails the build rather than shipping.

- **Decorative emoji must sit in an element with `aria-hidden="true"`.** Not a
  style preference: a heading written `🔥 โปรโมชั่น` is announced "fire
  โปรโมชั่น". If the emoji carries meaning the text does not — the 🥇🥈🥉 in
  `GameRankingBoard` replace the rank NUMBER for the top three — hide the emoji
  and add a `sr-only` span with the meaning, or the information disappears
  entirely for anyone not looking at it.
  **Emoji baked into a text prop cannot be marked**, so do not put one at the
  start of an announcement message. `Announcement6` renders its message three
  times for the marquee; a leading emoji there was read out three times.
- **No `href="#"` and no `onclick=`.** A link to nowhere costs a visitor a tap
  to discover it does nothing — delete the control instead (the footer's YOUTUBE
  button was removed for exactly this reason; add it back when a brand has a
  real URL). For back-to-top use `<a href="#top">`: `MainLayout` puts `id="top"`
  on `<html>` and `global.css` has `scroll-behavior: smooth`, which the
  reduced-motion block there overrides — an inline
  `onclick="window.scrollTo({behavior:'smooth'})"` cannot be overridden and
  ignores the preference.
- **`alt` must describe the picture.** Not `"bank"`, not `"Website Background"`,
  and not a counter like `"…ภาพที่ 3"`. For a promo banner, the alt IS the text
  printed on the banner — open the image and read it. For a decorative repeat
  (the carousel duplicates each slide twice so the loop has no seam) use
  `alt=""` **and** `aria-hidden="true"` on the wrapper.
- **FAQ accordions are `<details>`/`<summary>`.** All five `Faq*` variants were
  rewritten; none of them has a `<script>` any more. Do not reintroduce a
  button + `max-height` accordion: the old ones left the collapsed panel in the
  accessibility tree and in the tab order while invisible, and set
  `aria-expanded` with no `aria-controls` to point at. Use `<details name="…">`
  when only one should be open at a time. Keep the question in whatever heading
  level the variant already used — the `h2`/`h3` inventory is checked against
  the docx.
- **A widget whose title is a `<p>` needs `aria-label` on its `<section>`.**
  Those titles stay `<p>` on purpose (the `h2` list is diffed against the docx),
  which leaves the section with no accessible name. `ProviderGrid`,
  `GameRankingBoard`, `ReviewCardSumo2` and `LatestWinnersCyber` each carry one.
  **Do not promote the `<p>` to an `h2` to "fix" it** — that breaks the docx
  check on every future rebrand.

### Behaviour lives in `src/lib/`, not in a component `<script>`

Four things moved out of components into `src/lib/` because a rebrand rewrites
components and does not touch `src/lib/`. When you retheme one of these, change
its markup and its classes — **do not move the logic back inline.**

| module | used by | what it guards |
|---|---|---|
| `nav.ts` — `isActivePath()` | every `Navbar*` variant | percent-encoded Thai routes and trailing slashes |
| `liveCounter.ts` | `GameRankingBoard` | off-screen, background tab, reduced-motion |
| `winnersFeed.ts` | `LatestWinnersCyber` | same, plus server-rendered first rows |
| — (CSS only) | `SmoothCarousel` | replaced Swiper entirely |

Concretely:

- **Never write `isActive` by hand in a navbar.** All 16 variants used to carry
  the same three-line copy, and all 16 were wrong: `Astro.url.pathname` is
  percent-encoded, so on `/ทดลองเล่น` and `/ทางเข้า` no menu item highlighted at
  all. Write
  `const isActive = (path: string) => isActivePath(currentPath, path);` and
  import `isActivePath` from `../lib/nav`.
- **Never use `define:vars` on an indexable page.** It forces `is:inline`, which
  strips `type`/`async`/`defer` and leaves a parser-blocking script mid-document.
  Pass data as `<script type="application/json">` and read it from a normal
  bundled `<script>`. `verify-build.mjs` fails the build on an attribute-less
  `<script>` in any indexable page. (`login.astro`/`register.astro` are exempt
  and stay as they are — they are noindex redirect stubs.)
- **Never render a feed container empty and fill it from JS.** Server-render the
  first rows; JS replaces them. An empty container is invisible to crawlers,
  empty with JS off, and shifts the layout the moment it fills.
- **Never start a `setInterval`/recursive `setTimeout` without guards.** Anything
  that animates on a timer must stop when off screen, when the tab is hidden,
  and under `prefers-reduced-motion`. `GameRankingBoard`'s counters sit in a
  `hidden sm:flex` container, so an unguarded loop wakes the main thread on every
  phone to retype text nobody can see.
- **Do not reintroduce Swiper.** `SmoothCarousel` is a CSS animation now; Swiper
  was 158,890 bytes of JavaScript to slide four pictures, could not be paused,
  and ignored `prefers-reduced-motion`. The package is still in `package.json`
  but nothing imports it. If a brand needs a real interactive carousel, that is
  a deliberate decision to make out loud, not a default to fall back into.

One Astro detail worth knowing: **`<Image>`/`<Picture>` with `alt=""` serialise
it as a bare `alt`** — `<img src="…" alt loading="eager">`. That is valid HTML
and means exactly the same as `alt=""`, so decorative images are marked
correctly; do not "fix" it by inventing alt text. Any check you write for a
missing alt has to match the bare form too.

### Two files the build generates — leave both alone

**`src/styles/_sources.generated.css`** is rewritten by `tools/gen-tw-sources.mjs`
on every `npm run build` and `npm run dev` (npm's `prebuild`/`predev` hooks run
it; you never invoke it yourself). It lists the components in `src/components/`
that nothing reachable from `src/pages` or `src/layouts` renders, as
`@source not` lines, so Tailwind stops turning the inventory's hardcoded colours
into utility classes. Measured on UFAG8: 63 of 82 components excluded, and the
stylesheet went from 227 kB to 79 kB.

It is committed, and **it will show up in `git status` after almost every
rebrand** — because switching which navbar/footer/announcement is active changes
which components are reachable. That diff is correct and expected. Do not edit
the file, and do not "fix" it back.

The generator's failure mode is deliberately one-way: if anything goes wrong it
writes an empty list, which restores Tailwind's scan-everything default. The
worst case is a stylesheet as big as it used to be, never a missing style.

**Do not add a `<style>` block containing only
`.font-sans { font-family: var(--font-sans) }`.** Tailwind already generates
that exact rule from the `--font-sans` theme variable, so the block changes
nothing visually — but its presence makes Astro stamp a `data-astro-cid-*`
attribute onto every element the component renders. 43 components carried that
dead block; removing it dropped 502 attributes from the homepage to 114.

### Structured data — call the builder, never write JSON-LD by hand

Every indexable page gets its JSON-LD from `pageGraph()` in
`src/lib/schema.ts`. One call, in the frontmatter:

```ts
const graph = pageGraph(Astro, {
  name: "…",            // usually the page's H1
  description: "…",     // the SAME string passed to MainLayout's description=
  breadcrumb: [         // every page EXCEPT the homepage
    { name: "หน้าแรก", path: "/" },
    { name: "ทางเข้า", path: "/ทางเข้า" },
  ],
  faqs,                 // only if the page renders an FAQ — same array
});
```
```astro
<script type="application/ld+json" set:html={graph} />
```

**Never type a domain, and never build a URL with `+`.** Not
`Astro.url.origin + path`, not `"https://" + brand`, not
`encodeURIComponent(...)`. Every URL in the graph comes from `abs()`, which is
the only function that knows the trailing-slash and Thai-encoding rules. Before
this existed, all three pages that had JSON-LD claimed a URL that did not match
their own `<link rel=canonical>` — to a parser that is not a typo, it is markup
describing a *different page*.

`pageGraph` already fills in `@id` cross-references, `inLanguage`, `isPartOf`,
`publisher`, and the `Organization`/`WebSite` nodes. Do not add them by hand and
do not "tidy" the `@id` fragments or the node order — both are varied per brand
by the same hash that varies the `<head>`, for the same reason (see the comment
block at the top of `schema.ts`).

For anything beyond a plain page, pass the extras rather than hand-rolling:
`org: { contactPoints: [...] }` for a contact page, `extra: [itemList(ctx, …)]`
for a listing page. **Never add `Review`, `AggregateRating`, `sameAs`, or
`address`/`PostalAddress`** — the reviews on these sites are written
characters, so marking them up is fabricated structured data on a YMYL page;
`sameAs` would publish the cross-brand link `brandProfile.ts` exists to
prevent; and the contact address is visible text only, being a locality nobody
has verified when it is generated and the sharpest join key of the three when
it is a real registered one (see the `BRAND_ADDRESS` bullet in Phase 2).

`tools/verify-build.mjs` fails the build if a page's JSON-LD does not parse, and
warns if any self-referential URL disagrees with the canonical.

## Phase 4 — Fix stale asset references (the actual bug class this skill exists for)

The user will almost always call out `SmoothCarousel.astro` and
`promotion.astro` by name — both hardcode `import`s of specific asset
filenames/extensions that predate the new brand's asset drop, e.g.
`slide1.png` when only `slide1.webp` exists now. Grep for the stale
extension across `src/` and fix every hit, not just the two named
files:
```bash
grep -rlE "slide[0-9]\.png|banner[0-9]?\.png" src/
```

**The hero pick needs nothing from you — leave it alone.** `MainLayout`
pins `import.meta.glob("../assets/banner1.{png,webp,jpg,jpeg}")` by name and
throws if the file is missing, so there is no wide `banner*` glob to pick the
wrong number out of and no silent fallback to a previous brand's art. If both
`banner1.png` and `banner1.webp` are on disk it prefers the `.webp`. The
banner/slide roles themselves are Phase 1's; do not restate or re-derive them
here.

Do **not** reintroduce a `banner*` glob, a `preferredBannerPath` variable, or
any fallback chain while rethemeing. Every one of those existed and each cost a
brand something: an eager wide glob emits every match into `dist/` whether or
not a page renders it (3.1 MB of three dead brands' banners, every build), and
a fallback silently served old art when the new file was missing instead of
stopping the build.

**The OG/Twitter image comes from `slide1` (not a `public/` file).**
`MainLayout.astro` sets the `og:image`/`twitter:image` via the `ImageOg`
prop default. It **must** be `import ogImage from "../assets/slide1.png"`
+ `ImageOg = ogImage.src` — so the social preview always tracks the
current brand, because the uploader overwrites `src/assets/slide1.png`
every rebrand. Do **not** point it at a `/slide*.webp` (or any bare
`public/` path): the uploader never writes slides to `public/`, so a
hardcoded `public/slideN.webp` is a stale leftover from a previous brand
that silently ships as the wrong preview image. If you find `ImageOg`
pointing at a `public/` path during a rebrand, repoint it to the
`slide1` import.

## Phase 5 — Verify (always do this, it's where bugs surface)

1. `npm run build` — this is the **one** build for the whole rebrand (all
   editing from Phases 2–4.5 is already done), and it must complete with
   0 pages failing. A clean build only proves the code compiles, not that
   content/images are correct. Only build again if a check below turns up
   a bug you then fix.
   **Then read the route list the build printed and check it against the
   brand type.** A slot/casino brand must NOT have shipped `/ตรวจหวย` or
   `/แนวทาง`; a lottery brand must have both. This is the cheapest place to
   catch a page the *previous* brand left switched on — the build tells you
   exactly what routes exist, and nothing in this repo turns them off by
   itself (see the lottery trigger in Phase 4.5). Same check for any
   `บทความ`/`about-us` page the uploader scaffolded in an earlier run.

   **If a real URL was given this run, check `wrangler.toml` `name` changed
   with it.** `grep -n 'name =' wrangler.toml` — a name still reading as the
   previous brand means the next `wrangler deploy` overwrites that brand's
   live Worker and takes its site down. Nothing else in the build catches
   this, because the site builds perfectly either way.
1b. **`npm run build` also runs `node tools/verify-build.mjs` (a `postbuild`
   script), and a non-zero exit there fails the build.** Read its output —
   the rules it enforces are not repeated in this document, and it is the
   only check for several of them:

   - **ERRORS block.** Off-domain URLs (a previous brand's domain surviving
     in a component), `href` to a route that does not exist (inherited from
     whichever `Navbar*`/`Footer*` variant you switched to), a second `<h1>`,
     a missing `alt`, JSON-LD that does not parse, a canonical on the wrong
     host, a meta description over 200 characters, and the `wrangler.toml`
     name/domain mismatch above. Fix them; do not work around them.
   - **WARNINGS do not block** and are tagged with the improvement phase that
     owns them. They are pre-existing and expected — **do not go fix them
     during a rebrand.** Chasing a warning mid-rebrand means editing files
     outside the brief.
   - It also prints the `h1`/`h2` inventory per page. **That printout is the
     only heading list you need** — the script cannot read the brief, so
     diffing it against the docx checklist is still your job, but extracting
     the headings is not. Step 2 below says what to compare and in which
     directions; do not grep the pages for headings a second time.

   The script lives outside every file a rebrand rewrites, on purpose. If a
   new class of bug shows up twice, add a check to it instead of adding a
   paragraph here — a rule that exits non-zero cannot be skimmed.
2. Start `npm run dev`, `curl` the built pages, and grep the rendered
   HTML:
   - old brand name must not appear anywhere in the response body
   - old hue's Tailwind classes must not appear inside any
     `class="..."` attribute (grep separately for `class="[^"]*` vs.
     raw hits — raw hits inside a bundled `<style>` block from an
     out-of-scope component are expected noise, not a bug)
   - every `<img src=.../_image?href=...>` should reference the
     *new* asset filenames — grep for the old ones to make sure the
     Phase 4 glob trap didn't resurface
   - `grep -o 'og:image" content="[^"]*"' dist/index.html` should point
     at a hashed `/_astro/slide1.*` asset (the current brand's slide1),
     **not** a bare `/slide*.webp` — a `public/` path here means the OG
     image is a stale leftover (see the OG note in Phase 4)
   - grep for `undefined`, `NaN`, `[object Object]` as a cheap check
     for broken prop plumbing
   - **contact address**: `grep -o '<address[^>]*>.*</address>'
     dist/contact-us/index.html` must name **this** brand, a province, and
     an email at this brand's own host. The build now fails on a block that
     names the wrong brand or an email at the wrong host, so what is left
     for you to look at is that the footer renders it **at all** —
     `grep -c '<address' dist/index.html` should be `1`. A `0` means the
     footer swap in Phase 4.5 dropped it, which no gate catches
   - **`grep -c '<h2' dist/contact-us/index.html dist/ทางเข้า/index.html
     dist/promotion/index.html` must be `0` for all three** — the first two
     are button pages and `/promotion` is an image page, none of them are
     articles (Phase 4.5). Any hit means prose was written back in; delete the
     prose, don't demote the tag. On `/promotion` also eyeball that the prose
     above the image grid is still **one paragraph of about four lines** — the
     `h2` count alone won't catch six headingless paragraphs
   - `grep -c '<!--' dist/index.html` should be 0 — Astro ships HTML
     comments to output, so any `<!-- H2: … -->` section labels left in
     a page leak the docx outline (and often the old brand name) into
     production; remove them at the source (see Phase 2)
   - if any `*FloatingBadge` component is in play, re-check its
     vertical clearance (see the Phase 2 note) with the page's *actual*
     title text at a narrow/mobile width — a long title that wraps to
     2 lines is the trigger, and it won't show up in a desktop-width
     screenshot or in a build log
   - if a FAQ/accordion was wired up, count its item markup to confirm
     all entries rendered
   - **content completeness/order** — this is the heading diff from
     step 1, not a second pass. Do not re-extract the headings with a
     regex; the build already printed them per page. Read that list
     against the numbered docx checklist from Phase 2: same count,
     same text, same top-to-bottom order. A missing heading or a
     section out of order is a real bug — fix the page structure,
     don't just note it.

     **The diff runs both directions.** A heading in the page that is
     *not* in the checklist is as much a defect as a missing one — it
     means some piece of chrome took a heading tag (see the "only the
     article content may produce a heading" rule in Phase 2). Trace it
     to its component and downgrade it there, keeping the classes.
     Never reconcile the two lists by adding the stray heading to the
     checklist; the checklist is the docx, and editing it to match the
     page is what turns this check into a rubber stamp for good.
   - **heading-tag consistency**: `grep -o "<h3" dist/index.html |
     wc -l` (adjust the level to whatever the docx *doesn't* use) —
     should be 0 unless the docx genuinely has a nested sub-heading
     under those sections. A non-zero count almost always means a
     shared component (provider card, footer column, image-block
     title prop) is still hardcoding the wrong tag — grep the dist
     HTML around each hit to find which component to fix.
3. Stop the dev server when done — **by PID or by port, never by image
   name**. `taskkill /F /IM node.exe` kills every node process on the
   machine: the dev server, the uploader server that launched this run,
   and this agent's own CLI (the CLI runs on node), so the run dies
   mid-phase and the uploader cannot even report why. That happened on
   the 2026-07-30 SUDYOD888 run and cost the whole Phase 6 entry.
   On Windows, scope it to the port `npm run dev` actually uses (8888
   here, not Astro's default 4321):

   ```powershell
   $c = Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8888 -State Listen -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   if ($c) { Stop-Process -Id $c.OwningProcess -Force }
   ```

   This is best effort. If the scoped kill fails or the cmdlet is
   unavailable, leave the dev server running and move on — a leftover
   dev server is harmless. Never widen the kill to make it succeed.

## Phase 6 — Report, and do NOT write `workspec.md`

**Do not append to `workspec.md`.** It is not maintained any more (owner's
call, 2026-08-05). The file stays at the repo root as history; leave it alone.
Writing a full entry — goal, section inventory, file-by-file change list,
verification steps, out-of-scope — cost a couple of minutes of every run to
produce a record nobody read back, in a 500 KB file the build has to scan.

Everything it held now lives somewhere that gets read:

| เคยอยู่ใน workspec | อยู่ที่ไหนแทน |
|---|---|
| ไฟล์ที่แก้ | `git status` / `git diff` — ตรงกว่าและไม่มีทางลืม |
| variant ที่รอบก่อนใช้ | โค้ดที่ shipped อยู่ อ่านด้วย `git show HEAD:...` (Phase 2) |
| บั๊กที่เจอ + วิธีแก้ | commit message |
| การ verify ที่รันจริง | ผล `npm run build` ที่ต่อท้ายด้วย `verify-build` |
| สิ่งที่จงใจไม่แตะ | **สรุปที่คุณเขียนให้ operator ตอนจบ** |

**Write that closing summary instead.** It is the one thing here an operator
actually reads, it costs nothing extra (you are ending the run anyway), and it
is where every "note this in the workspec" instruction elsewhere in this file
now points. Cover:

- ชื่อแบรนด์ · โดเมนที่ตั้งใน `site:` · ฟอนต์
- variant ที่เลือกแต่ละตระกูล เป็น before→after (`Navbar: NavbarStyle11 →
  NavbarStyle6`) และถ้าตระกูลไหนใช้ตัวเดิม **ต้องบอกเหตุผล**
- `h1`/`h2`/`h3` ที่ได้ เทียบกับ checklist จาก docx
- ของที่จงใจไม่แตะ และหน้าที่ยังเป็นของแบรนด์เก่า (ถ้ามี)
- อะไรที่ operator ต้องไปทำต่อเอง (เช่น description ที่ยังสั้นกว่า 150)

## Phase 7 — Follow-up single-component redesign requests

After the initial rebrand, the user routinely comes back with a narrow
ask on one already-themed component: "re design Announcement6 again",
"เปลี่ยน card แบบใหม่" for the review section, "redesign LoginRtpSection"
(the login-form + RTP-table two-column section extracted out of
`index.astro`), etc. Treat these as a distinct, smaller task — don't
re-run the full rebrand:

1. **Read the file fresh first.** It may have been hand-edited (by the
   user or a formatter) since your last write — don't assume your last
   known version is current.
2. **Scope the change precisely from the user's wording.** "Redesign
   the card" or "เปลี่ยนชื่อ" is about markup/CSS/copy — never touch
   sibling components, the section that renders it, or unrelated
   files unless asked. If the user says "don't change the text/other
   parts anymore" after a prior redesign, that's a hard constraint:
   keep every string in any `const data = [...]` array byte-identical
   (names, roles, review content, numbers) and only rewrite
   markup/CSS. Verify this afterward with a literal grep of the built
   output for a couple of the preserved strings, not just a visual
   diff.
3. **Make the new version visibly different from the last one**, not
   just a recolor — change the actual layout shape (e.g. spotlight +
   list → equal grid with an accent spine, dashed ticket → glowing
   pill capsule). Reusing the exact same div structure with new class
   names isn't a redesign.
4. Reuse the established palette/motifs from Phase 3 (cyan/gold, "Live"
   pulse-dot pattern, porthole/wave/shark visual language) so the new
   version still feels like the same site, not a different brand.
5. Rebuild (`npm run build`) and re-verify per Phase 5 before reporting
   done — a redesign that breaks the build isn't done.
6. Report what changed and why — which component, what it looked like before,
   what drove the new shape. In the reply, not in a file (Phase 6).
